# Network Pruning and Growth - Probabilistic Optimization
Data used in _Network Pruning and Growth - Probabilistic Optimization_

## Data
- `Demands/`: demand lists for the tested networks of different sizes; in the first line of each file the two numbers are the graph order and the number of pairs in the file, respectively; and each of the following pairs consists of source and destination nodes.
- `Networks/RandomRegular`: topology files of random regular networks of degree $3$ and order $N(=50,100,150,200)$, each file starts with `num_of_nodes` and `num_of_edges`, and the edges (node pairs) follow.
-  `Networks/CONUS60/CONUS60.txt` has a similar structure with random regular graphs, and has a distance as the weight in the third column.
